        <h3>TERMS & CONDITIONS – including policies & procedures</h3>

        <h4>Duty of Care</h4>
        <p>1.1 Barbara Elaine Sprankle, Ella Ballinger & all carers providing pet care with Barbara Elaine Sprankle and
        Ella Ballinger (from here-on known as “Kitties In The City and Carers”) highly respects the client’s trust with the
        care of their pet and where necessary, having access to the client’s property. No personal information will be
        shared with or sold to 3rd parties.</p>
        <p>1.2 Kitties In The City and Carers will utilise their skill and knowledge to ensure the standards of care provided
        to the animals and any property is appropriate.</p>
        <p>1.3 A change in a pet’s routine and circumstances can cause varying degrees of distress and unpredictable or
        abnormal behaviour, particularly if their owner is on holiday - pets have no concept or ability to understand their
        owner’s absence is temporary and they will be coming back. Kitties In The City and Carers understands this
        and will offer comfort and reassurance whilst trying, as far as is practically possible, to maintain their normal
        daily routines.</p>
        <p>1.4 In the event of extreme weather which may have an adverse effect on your pet e.g. heat or thunder storms,
        Kitties In The City and Carers shall at their sole discretion, take whatever action they consider necessary,
        including not carrying out scheduled exercise until it is, in their opinion, safe to do so.</p>
        <p>1.5 It is important that all information & instruction to Kitties In The City and Carers is given in writing by the
        client. Misunderstandings can arise via verbal instruction.</p>

        <h4>Your Pet</h4>
        <p>2.1 Dogs: The client shall provide secure collars with name/address/phone tags and leads.</p>
        <p>2.2 It is expected that all dogs and cats with outdoor access, are treated for ticks, fleas and worms (including
        lungworm) at appropriate intervals. Any illness or problem that may arise through failure to do so is solely the
        pet owner’s responsibility. Kitties In The City and Carers take no responsibility for any illness that may arise
        because of failure to adequately protect your pet(s).</p>
        <p>2.3 Should your pet become ill during your absence and whilst under the care of Kitties In The City and Carers,
        the client will be informed as soon as practically possible.</p>
        <p>2.4 If your pet needs to be taken to a veterinary surgeon in case of an emergency, all efforts will be made to
        take your pet to your registered veterinary practice. Should this not be possible (out of surgery hours or if
        distance is an issue) Kitties In The City and Carers has the right to take your pet to the nearest veterinary
        practice for treatment.</p>
        <p>2.5 The client will be responsible for any treatment charges and relating expenses incurred as a result. Whilst
        every effort will be made to keep the client informed before any emergency procedure, Kitties In The City and
        Carers reserves the right to instruct the veterinary surgeon to undertake any procedure in the effort to keep
        your pet alive until the client instructs further.</p>
        <p>2.6 Should the veterinary surgeon decide that your pet needs to be euthanized (due to painful illness or injury),
        Kitties In The City and Carers will not be liable for the loss of your pet.</p>
        <p>2.7 In the event that the pet should die due to unforeseen circumstances or natural causes, Kitties In The City

        towards any property, person or other animal. This will include, but is not limited to veterinary, medical and
        legal fees.</p>

        medical treatment to Kitties In The City and Carers that arises as a result.</p>
        <p>2.12 In the event of a pet's behaviour exceeding what would be considered normal or acceptable towards
        people or other animals, Kitties In The City and Carers shall, in their sole discretion, take whatever action they
        consider necessary in the best interest of the animal and other animals or people which may be encountered.

        the pet in a boarding kennel.</p>
        <p>2.13 Off-lead dog walking will only be considered with prior written consent and evidence of the dog returning

        designated or allowed.</p>
        <p>2.14 For all cats with access to a cat flap whilst not under the direct supervision of Kitties In The City and
        Carers, the client understands that Kitties In The City and Carers will not be held responsible for the loss or
        non-return of a pet. Elaine and Carers will report any non-returning pet to the owner when first noticed. It is
        then the owner's responsibility to report the pet missing to their veterinary practice and make efforts to find the
        pet. Kitties In The City and Carers may assist where possible, but will not be responsible for the return of a lost
        pet that had access to a cat-flap.</p>
        <p>2.15 It shall be the client’s sole responsibility to ensure that Kitties In The City and Carers is fully aware of any
        health issues the pet is experiencing, or has suffered in the past. Kitties In The City and Carers cannot be held
        liable for any actions or omissions which result in problems or complications for anything not disclosed in
        writing.</p>
